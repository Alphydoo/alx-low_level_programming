### **My first program on C**
### **Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming**
---
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the Alx-Holberton Software Engineering program facilitated by ALX. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

0x00. C - Hello, World
0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
0x03. C - Debugging
0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
0x08. C - Recursion
0x0A. C - argc, argv
0x09. C - Static libraries
0x0B. C - malloc, free
0x0C. C - More malloc, free 
0x0D. C - Preprocessor
0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
0x0F. C - Function pointers
0x10. C - Variadic functions
0x11. C - printf
0x14. C - Bit manipulation
0x12. C - Singly linked lists
0x13. C - More singly linked lists
0x15. C - File I/O
0x16. C - Simple Shell
